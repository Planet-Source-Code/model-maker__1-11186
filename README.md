### Description

This program lets you make your own 3D models and use them in games you are developing. I made this program cos I can't find anything like it elsewhere, and making 3D models in notepad it really hard. I've added a few more bits to it now, including an export and DirectX viewer thing.
 
### More Info
 
You like, draw boxs, and then they go 3D and stuff.

You'll end up with a 3D model, but not in this version, but you will in the next version. It'll export to seperate face format and Direct 3D compatible
